        <h1>About JAVA</h1>
        <p>
                Java was conceived by James Gosling, Patrick Naughton, Chris Warth, Ed Frank,
                and Mike Sheridan at Sun Microsystems in 1991. This language was initially called
                “Oak” but was renamed “Java” in 1995. Somewhat surprisingly, the original impetus
                for Java was not the Internet! Instead, the primary motivation was the need for a
                platform-independent language that could be used to create software to be embedded
                in various consumer electronic devices, such as toasters, microwave ovens, and
                remote controls. As you can probably guess, many different types of CPUs are used
                as controllers. The trouble was that (at that time) most computer languages were
                designed to be compiled into machine code that was targeted for a specific type of
                CPU. For example, consider the C++ language.
